# Simple Password Code Challenge

Have the function SimplePassword(str) take the str parameter being passed and determine if it passes as a valid password that follows the list of constraints:<br/>

1. It must have a capital letter.<br/>
2. It must contain at least one number.<br/>
3. It must contain a punctuation mark or mathematical symbol.<br/>
4. It cannot have the word "password" in the string.<br/>
5. It must be longer than 7 characters and shorter than 31 characters.<br/>

If all the above constraints are met within the string, the your program should return the string true, otherwise your program should return the string false. For example: if str is "apple!M7" then your program should return "true".
